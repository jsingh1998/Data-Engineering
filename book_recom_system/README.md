# Book Recommendation System Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a **Book Recommendation System** that leverages cloud and big data technologies to process and analyze large-scale book datasets. The system provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences, leveraging advanced data engineering and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests books by identifying patterns in user-book interactions.
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Matches books based on features such as genre, author, and more.
- **Big Data Processing**: Efficiently processes large datasets using distributed computing.
- **Cloud Integration**: Scalable and cost-effective solution leveraging Azure services.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Cloud Services**:
  - **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**: For storing large datasets in a secure and scalable way.
  - **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: To orchestrate data movement and transformation workflows.
  - **Databricks**: For big data processing and building machine learning models.
- **Programming & Frameworks**:
  - **Python**: Core programming language.
  - **PySpark**: Distributed data processing for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for local data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`Book Recommendation System Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook detailing data ingestion, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and recommendation algorithms.
- **`adls_scripts/`**: Scripts for interacting with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.


## 📊 Data
The project uses datasets containing:
- **User Ratings**: User preferences for different books.
- **Book Metadata**: Features such as title, genre, author, and publication year.
